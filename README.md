## ✨ Key Features & Architecture

### 1. 🔐 Clerk Authentication & Managed Sign-In / Sign-Up
* **Flexible Authentication**: Supports both standard password credentials and seamless Clerk authentication for baker onboarding.
* **Per-Baker Data Isolation**: Strict multi-tenant security ensuring each kitchen's catalog, customer memory, and sales stats remain completely isolated.

### 2. 📱 Omnichannel Meta Webhooks (Instagram & WhatsApp)
* **Instagram Direct Messages**: Real-time webhook listener (`/api/webhooks/instagram`) for auto-replying to customer DMs.
* **WhatsApp Embedded Signup**: Built-in Meta Connect integration for onboarding business phone numbers directly from the Baker Dashboard.
* **QuickTalk Chips**: Interactive quick-response chips for instant menu, price, and order status inquiries.

### 3. 🔍 Automated OCR Payment Slip Verification
* **Zero Manual Ledger Checks**: Built-in vision analyzer (`receipt-analyzer.ts`) scans payment screenshots (Easypaisa, JazzCash, Bank Transfers).
* **Automatic Verification**: Matches transfer amounts and destination accounts, updates order status to "Paid", and alerts the AI assistant.

### 4. 🧠 Smart AI Assistant & RAG Memory Engine
* **24/7 Smart Bot**: Auto-answers questions regarding eggless availability, nut allergies, delivery areas, and custom cake lead times.
* **Customer Memory**: Remembers past buyer preferences (allergies, favorite cakes, delivery locations) to provide personalized greetings on return.
* **Auto-Reindexing**: Updating catalog prices or toggling stock availability instantly rebuilds the vector knowledge index.

### 5. 📊 Analytics & Customer Retention Hub
* **Performance Charts**: Filter revenue and order volume by daily, weekly, and monthly views.
* **Customer Retention Stats**: Track repeat customer ratios, average customer lifetime value (CLV), and price band trends.
* **Smart Marketing Campaigns**: One-click broadcast templates (New Mango Launches, Welcoming Discounts, Eid/Festival Greetings) targeted at specific customer segments.
